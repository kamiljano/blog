Hi! My name is Kamil!

I originally come from Poland, but I have moved around quite a lot. I've lived for half a year in Eindhoven (Netherlands)
then for 3.5 years in Jyväskylä (Finland). Finally I decided that there had to be more to life than this
and moved to Paris (France), but after a year I decided that France is just one of those countries that
is nice to visit, but horrible to live in and moved back to Finland, although this time to Helsinki and I have lived
here ever since.

I'm a full stack software developer (duh... obviously... it's one of very few professions that allow you to move around
so much without really knowing the local language). I specialize mostly in Java, JavaScript and TypeScript, but 
I have worked briefly with a few other languages, like Go, Kotlin, Python and recently Ruby (God, please save me from 
this last one).

I do a lot of DevOps too. Working closely mostly with AWS, CloudFormation, Terraform and stuff.

Should you trust anything I write over here? Well... It's up to you. I do have years of professional experience
and I consider myself to be pretty good in what I do, but obviously there are people way more knowledgable than me 
out there. All I'm trying to do here is describe solutions to various problems that I couldn't find anywhere else...
and there great many of those.
